title: Launching Supp – Mindful Status Management in WFH World

[Supp](https://suppme.netlify.app/) is a simple browser extension for mindful status management. You can form group with your coworkers or friends, and Supp gives you an instant glance at what they are doing & who's free or busy.

## The Idea

It’s designed mainly for the current remote/WFH heavy workspace, where working peacefully has, startlingly, become quite challenging.There are too many sync-ups, just to know what everyone is doing in the team.Along with frequent Slack/Hangouts messages like "Are you available for a call?", "What are you doing?". Not to mention some people who don't even bother to ask your availability before shooting out their pings.

I was unable to find disturbance-free time to focus on my own work and wished there was an automated way to know what everyone was doing & see if someone is free to be bothered with or not before pinging them.

Been there, felt that? Supp is for you!
